This is a personal project for learning about Streamlit. 
It's also designed to be a fun party game inspired by the show "Archer" and James Bond films.

The game's pretty simple: Each player has a country and a secret agent name. They also receive a target agent (but *not* the target country)
and two other agent identities (target *and* country). The goal is to track down the target's hidden country-agent pair by trading information
with other players.
